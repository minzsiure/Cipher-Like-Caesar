# Cipher-Like-Caesar
Using the idea of Caesar Cipher to encrypt/decrypt your message!

In this problem we will implement a simple cipher.

Here is some important vocabulary we will use going forward:

Encryption - the process of obscuring or encoding messages to make them unreadable
Decryption - converting encrypted messages back to their original, readable form
Cipher - a technique or algorithm used for performing encryption and decryption
Plaintext - the original, readable message
Ciphertext - the encrypted message. A ciphertext still contains all of the original message information, even though it looks like gibberish.

The idea of the Caesar Cipher (Wikipedia page here) is to pick an integer amount and shift every letter of your message by that amount.

Suppose the shift we choose is an integer k. Then, all instances of the ith letter of the extended alphabet that appear in the plaintext should become the (i + k)th letter of the alphabet in the ciphertext.
